# Industrial sensor operations for OT

Using Operational Insights to receive sensor data from Kinetic, present graphically and send commands based on conditions. Interact with Operations Teams (OT) via Webex Teams to manage the sensors, get the information required in a easier way, engage quickly with the right teams.


## Business/Technical Challenge

We have everyday more sensors measuring information and generating data. But to make sense of the data collected and more than this to make this information available to be easy consumed by operations teams is not an easy task. Also changing the way the different teams get access to the data and interact with the sensor and assets, can change the whole experience and make it more effective.

## Proposed Solution

The solution proposed encompass the integration of Cisco Kinetic with Operational Insights via APIs to collect data from sensors, process it, make it available in a visual dashboard and enable actions/rules with this data. Also to make it relevant and easier to be operated, the objetive is to create a ChatOps Bot to access the sensor and assets inventory, as well as get location information, sensor data and alerts based on the business and operations rules.
